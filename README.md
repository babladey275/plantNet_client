# PlantNet

PlantNet is an e-commerce platform dedicated to plants. It offers an intuitive user interface for both customers and sellers. Customers can view plant details, place orders, and track their purchases. Sellers can manage their plant inventory, add new plants to the catalog, and process orders through a specialized dashboard.

The application is built using **React** for the frontend, with a state management system based on **React Query** and an intuitive routing system using **React Router**. The app is styled using **Tailwind CSS** and powered by **Vite** for fast development and build processes.
